"""End-to-end tests: run a real MCDR against the real packaged plugin.

These tests boot an actual MCDReforged instance in a temporary directory, load
the ``.mcdr`` artifact produced by ``pack.py``, and drive a fake Minecraft server
through a complete lifecycle.

The suite does **not** treat "the assertions pass" as evidence that the safety
property holds — see ``test_hidden_line_keeps_process_flag_end_to_end`` for the
canary that makes ``InfoActionFlag.hidden()`` and ``InfoActionFlag.discarded()``
observably different. Without that canary both implementations pass every other
assertion here, because the default rule only ever matches noise lines, and noise
lines never drive MCDR's lifecycle detection.

They are slower than the unit suite. Skip with::
